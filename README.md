# Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors

[See it live](https://m-mackey.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

A 5 round game of rock, paper, scissors played against CPU. Project is part of [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

I'm still working on a way to remove the buttons or the event after a winner of 5 rounds is reached. 

Some things used and learned: loops, getting a random number, the ternary operator
