# Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors

Currently, a 5 round game of rock, paper, scissors played against CPU, played entirely in the console. Project is part of [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). Will soon be updated to have an actual UI!

Some things used and learned: loops, getting a random number, the ternary operator
